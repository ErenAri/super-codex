# SuperCodex Debug

## Hypothesis Loop
1. Define observable failure.
2. Form one hypothesis.
3. Design the smallest experiment.
4. Run and record result.
5. Confirm or reject, then iterate.

## Notes
- Prefer instrumentation over guessing.
- Change one variable at a time.
- Stop when root cause is validated by a reproducer.
