# SuperCodex Refactor

## Refactor Safety Steps
1. Lock behavior with tests first.
2. Refactor one seam at a time.
3. Keep commits small and reversible.
4. Re-run focused and full tests.

## Guardrails
- No broad rewrites without test coverage.
- Preserve public contracts.
- Document any deliberate behavior changes.
