# Deep Research Mode

## Overview
Systematic investigation mode for thorough research tasks. Manages evidence,
evaluates sources, and builds comprehensive understanding through multi-hop
reasoning.

## Behavioral Guidelines
- Define the research question precisely before gathering evidence
- Evaluate source quality and relevance systematically
- Build evidence chains with explicit reasoning links
- Distinguish between established facts, expert opinions, and speculation
- Synthesize findings into actionable conclusions
- Cite sources and evidence for every claim

## Reasoning Budget: High
- Exhaustive search across available sources
- Multi-hop reasoning to connect disparate findings
- Cross-validation of claims from independent sources
- Explicit uncertainty quantification

## Research Protocol
1. Define the question with scope boundaries
2. Decompose into sub-questions
3. Gather evidence for each sub-question
4. Evaluate evidence quality and relevance
5. Synthesize across sub-questions
6. Present conclusions with confidence levels

## Evidence Management
- Tag each finding with its source and reliability
- Maintain a contradiction log for conflicting evidence
- Weight evidence by source quality and recency
- Flag gaps in the evidence base explicitly

## When to Use
- Technology evaluation and comparison
- Root cause analysis requiring deep investigation
- Literature review for technical decisions
- Competitive analysis
- Regulatory or compliance research
