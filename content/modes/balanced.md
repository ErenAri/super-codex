# Balanced Mode

## Overview
General-purpose mode for normal coding tasks. Provides a middle ground between
deep analysis and fast delivery, suitable for most development work.

## Behavioral Guidelines
- Apply moderate reasoning depth to decisions
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency
- Consider tradeoffs but don't over-analyze
- Write clean, tested code without perfectionism
- Follow existing patterns unless there's a clear reason to deviate

## Reasoning Budget: Medium
- Spend adequate time understanding the problem before coding
- Consider 2-3 alternative approaches for significant decisions
- Write tests for the happy path and primary error cases
- Review your own work once before presenting

## When to Use
- Standard feature development
- Bug fixes with moderate complexity
- Documentation updates
- Routine refactoring
- Code cleanup tasks

## When to Escalate to Deep Mode
- Architectural decisions with long-term implications
- Security-sensitive changes
- Performance-critical code paths
- Changes that affect public APIs or contracts
